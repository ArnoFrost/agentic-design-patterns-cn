The field of artificial intelligence is at a fascinating inflection point. We are moving beyond building models that can simply process information to creating intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and act to achieve complex goals with ambiguous tasks. These "agentic" systems, as this book so aptly describes them, represent the next frontier in AI, and their development is a challenge that excites and inspires us at Google.

<mark>人工智能领域正处于一个令人着迷的转折点。我们正在从构建仅能处理信息的模型，转向创建能够推理、规划并付诸行动以完成复杂且含糊任务的智能系统。正如本书恰当地描述的那样，这些「智能体」系统代表了 AI 的下一个前沿领域，它们的发展是一个让我们在 Google 感到兴奋与鼓舞的挑战。</mark>

"Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems" arrives at the perfect moment to guide us on this journey. The book rightly points out that the power of large language models, the cognitive engines of these agents, must be harnessed with structure and thoughtful design. Just as design patterns revolutionized software engineering by providing a common language and reusable solutions to common problems, the agentic patterns in this book will be foundational for building robust, scalable, and reliable intelligent systems.

<mark>《智能体设计模式：构建智能系统的实践指南》在恰当的时机到来，为我们的这段旅程提供指引。本书明确指出，大语言模型作为这些智能体的认知引擎，其强大能力必须通过结构化、深思熟虑的设计来加以驾驭。正如设计模式通过提供通用语言与可复用解法而革新软件工程一样，本书中的智能体模式将成为构建稳健、可扩展且可靠的智能系统的基础。</mark>

The metaphor of a "canvas" for building agentic systems is one that resonates deeply with our work on Google's Vertex AI platform. We strive to provide developers with the most powerful and flexible canvas on which to build the next generation of AI applications. This book provides the practical, hands-on guidance that will empower developers to use that canvas to its full potential. By exploring patterns from prompt chaining and tool use to agent-to-agent collaboration, self-correction, safety and guardrails, this book offers a comprehensive toolkit for any developer looking to build sophisticated AI agents.

<mark>将智能体系统比作「画布」的隐喻，与我们在 Google Vertex AI 平台上的工作深度契合。我们致力于为开发者提供强大而灵活的画布，供其构建新一代 AI 应用。本书提供了务实、可操作的指导，帮助开发者充分发挥这块画布的潜力。通过涵盖从提示链、工具使用到智能体间协作、自我纠正、安全与护栏等模式，本书为希望打造复杂 AI 智能体的开发者提供了完整工具箱。</mark>

The future of AI will be defined by the creativity and ingenuity of developers who can build these intelligent systems. "Agentic Design Patterns" is an indispensable resource that will help to unlock that creativity. It provides the essential knowledge and practical examples to not only understand the "what" and "why" of agentic systems, but also the "how."

<mark>AI 的未来将由能够构建这些智能系统的开发者的创造力与独创性所定义。《智能体设计模式》是一份不可或缺的资源，有助于释放这种创造力。它提供了必要的知识与实践示例，不仅帮助我们理解智能体系统的「是什么」与「为什么」，也阐明了「如何做」。</mark>

I am thrilled to see this book in the hands of the developer community. The patterns and principles within these pages will undoubtedly accelerate the development of innovative and impactful AI applications that will shape our world for years to come.

<mark>我很高兴这本书走进开发者社区。书中的模式与原则无疑将加速创新且具影响力的 AI 应用的开发，这些应用将在未来数年塑造我们的世界。</mark>

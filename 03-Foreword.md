# Foreword | <mark>序言</mark>

The field of artificial intelligence is at a fascinating inflection point. We are moving beyond building models that can simply process information to creating intelligent systems that can reason, plan, and act to achieve complex goals with ambiguous tasks. These "agentic" systems, as this book so aptly describes them, represent the next frontier in AI, and their development is a challenge that excites and inspires us at Google.

<mark>人工智能领域正处于一个令人着迷的转折点。我们正从构建仅能处理信息的模型，转向创建能够推理、规划并采取行动来实现复杂模糊目标的智能系统。正如本书所精准描述的，这些「智能体」系统代表了 AI 的下一个前沿，其发展让我们在谷歌倍感兴奋和鼓舞。</mark>

"Agentic Design Patterns: A Hands-On Guide to Building Intelligent Systems" arrives at the perfect moment to guide us on this journey. The book rightly points out that the power of large language models, the cognitive engines of these agents, must be harnessed with structure and thoughtful design. Just as design patterns revolutionized software engineering by providing a common language and reusable solutions to common problems, the agentic patterns in this book will be foundational for building robust, scalable, and reliable intelligent systems.

<mark>《智能体设计模式：构建智能系统的实践指南》恰逢其时，为我们的旅程指明方向。本书明确指出，大语言模型作为智能体的认知引擎，其强大能力需要通过结构化和深思熟虑的设计来有效运用。正如设计模式通过提供通用语言和可复用解决方案而革新软件工程，本书中的智能体模式也将成为构建稳健、可扩展、可靠智能系统的基石。</mark>

The metaphor of a "canvas" for building agentic systems is one that resonates deeply with our work on Google's Vertex AI platform. We strive to provide developers with the most powerful and flexible canvas on which to build the next generation of AI applications. This book provides the practical, hands-on guidance that will empower developers to use that canvas to its full potential. By exploring patterns from prompt chaining and tool use to agent-to-agent collaboration, self-correction, safety and guardrails, this book offers a comprehensive toolkit for any developer looking to build sophisticated AI agents.

<mark>将智能体系统比作「画布」的隐喻，与我们在 Google Vertex AI 平台上的工作深度共鸣。我们致力于为开发者提供最强大、最灵活的画布，供其构建下一代 AI 应用。本书提供了实用且可操作的指导，帮助开发者充分释放这块画布的潜力。本书涵盖了从提示链、工具使用到智能体协作、自我纠正、安全护栏等模式，为致力于构建复杂 AI 智能体的开发者提供了完整的工具箱。</mark>

The future of AI will be defined by the creativity and ingenuity of developers who can build these intelligent systems. "Agentic Design Patterns" is an indispensable resource that will help to unlock that creativity. It provides the essential knowledge and practical examples to not only understand the "what" and "why" of agentic systems, but also the "how."

<mark>AI 的未来将由那些能够构建智能系统的开发者的创造力和独创性来定义。《智能体设计模式》是释放这种创造力不可或缺的资源。它提供了必要的知识和实践示例，不仅帮助我们理解智能体系统「是什么」「为什么」，更展示了「如何做」。</mark>

I am thrilled to see this book in the hands of the developer community. The patterns and principles within these pages will undoubtedly accelerate the development of innovative and impactful AI applications that will shape our world for years to come.

<mark>我非常高兴看到这本书能够惠及开发者社区。书中的模式和原则无疑将加速创新和有影响力的 AI 应用的开发，这些应用必将在未来数年塑造我们的世界。</mark>

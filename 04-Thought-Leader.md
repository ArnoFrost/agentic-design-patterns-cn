# A Thought Leader's Perspective: Power and Responsibility | <mark>思想领袖的观点：权力与责任</mark>

Of all the technology cycles I've witnessed over the past four decades—from the birth of the personal computer and the web, to the revolutions in mobile and cloud—none has felt quite like this one. For years, the discourse around Artificial Intelligence was a familiar rhythm of hype and disillusionment, the so-called "AI summers" followed by long, cold winters. But this time, something is different. The conversation has palpably shifted. If the last eighteen months were

<mark>在我过去四十年见证的所有技术周期中——从个人计算机和互联网的诞生，到移动和云计算的革命——没有一个像这次这样让人印象深刻。多年来，围绕人工智能的讨论是一种熟悉的炒作和失望的节奏，所谓的"AI 夏天"之后总是跟着漫长寒冷的冬天。但这一次，情况有所不同。对话已经明显发生了转变。如果说过去十八个月是</mark>

about the engine—the breathtaking, almost vertical ascent of Large Language Models (LLMs)—the next era will be about the car we build around it. It will be about the frameworks that harness this raw power, transforming it from a generator of plausible text into a true agent of action.

<mark>关于引擎——大语言模型 (LLM) 令人叹为观止、几乎垂直的上升——那么下一个时代将是关于我们围绕它构建的汽车。它将是关于驾驭这种原始力量的框架，将其从一个看似合理的文本生成器转变为真正的行动智能体。</mark>

I admit, I began as a skeptic. Plausibility, I've found, is often inversely proportional to one's own knowledge of a subject. Early models, for all their fluency, felt like they were operating with a kind of impostor syndrome, optimized for credibility over correctness. But then came the inflection point, a step-change brought about by a new class of "reasoning" models. Suddenly, we weren't just conversing with a statistical machine that predicted the next word in a sequence;

<mark>我承认，我最初是一个怀疑论者。我发现，可信度往往与一个人对某个主题的了解成反比。早期的模型尽管流畅，但感觉就像患有一种冒名顶替综合症，针对可信度而非正确性进行了优化。但随后出现了转折点，由新一类"推理"模型带来的阶跃变化。突然间，我们不再仅仅是与一个预测序列中下一个词的统计机器对话；</mark>

we were getting a peek into a nascent form of cognition.

<mark>我们正在窥探一种新生的认知形式。</mark>

The first time I experimented with one of the new agentic coding tools, I felt that familiar spark of magic. I tasked it with a personal project I'd never found the time for: migrating a charity website from a simple web builder to a proper, modern CI/CD environment. For the next twenty minutes, it went to work, asking clarifying questions, requesting credentials, and providing status updates. It felt less like using a tool and more like collaborating with a junior developer. When it presented me with a fully deployable package, complete with impeccable documentation and unit tests, I was floored.

<mark>当我第一次尝试这些新的智能体编程工具之一时，感受到了那种熟悉的魔法火花。我给它安排了一个我一直没有时间做的个人项目：将一个慈善网站从简单的网站构建器迁移到适当的现代 CI/CD 环境。在接下来的二十分钟里，它开始工作，询问澄清问题，请求凭据，并提供状态更新。感觉不像是在使用工具，更像是与一个初级开发者合作。当它向我展示一个完全可部署的包时，包括无可挑剔的文档和单元测试，我震惊了。</mark>

Of course, it wasn't perfect. It made mistakes. It got stuck. It required my supervision and, crucially, my judgment to steer it back on course. The experience drove home a lesson I've learned the hard way over a long career: you cannot afford to trust blindly. Yet, the process was fascinating. Peeking into its "chain of thought" was like watching a mind at work—messy, non-linear, full of starts, stops, and self-corrections, not unlike our own human reasoning. It wasn't a straight line; it was a random walk toward a solution. Here was the kernel of something new: not just an intelligence that could generate content, but one that could generate a *plan*.

<mark>当然，它并不完美。它犯错误。它会卡住。它需要我的监督，关键是需要我的判断来将其重新引导到正确的道路上。这次经历让我深刻理解了一个在漫长职业生涯中艰难学到的教训：你不能盲目信任。然而，这个过程令人着迷。窥视其"思维链"就像观察一个思维在工作——混乱、非线性、充满开始、停止和自我纠正，与我们自己的人类推理没有什么不同。这不是一条直线；这是朝向解决方案的随机游走。这里是新事物的核心：不仅仅是一个可以生成内容的智能，而是一个可以生成*计划*的智能。</mark>

This is the promise of agentic frameworks. It's the difference between a static subway map and a dynamic GPS that reroutes you in real-time. A classic rules-based automaton follows a fixed path; when it encounters an unexpected obstacle, it breaks. An AI agent, powered by a reasoning model, has the potential to observe, adapt, and find another way. It possesses a form of digital common sense that allows it to navigate the countless edge cases of reality. It represents a shift from simply telling a computer *what* to do, to explaining *why* we need something done and trusting it to figure out the *how*.

<mark>这就是智能体框架的承诺。这是静态地铁地图和实时重新路由的动态 GPS 之间的区别。经典的基于规则的自动机遵循固定路径；当它遇到意外障碍时，就会崩溃。由推理模型驱动的 AI 智能体有潜力观察、适应并找到另一条路。它拥有一种数字化常识，允许它应对现实中无数的边缘情况。它代表了从简单地告诉计算机*做什么*，转向解释*为什么*我们需要完成某事并信任它找出*如何*做的转变。</mark>

As exhilarating as this new frontier is, it brings a profound sense of responsibility, particularly from my vantage point as the CIO of a global financial institution. The stakes are immeasurably high. An agent that makes a mistake while creating a recipe for a "Chicken Salmon Fusion Pie" is a fun anecdote. An agent that makes a mistake while executing a trade, managing risk, or handling client data is a real problem. I've read the disclaimers and the cautionary tales: the web automation agent that, after failing a login, decided to email a member of parliament to complain about login walls. It's a darkly humorous reminder that we are dealing with a technology we don't fully understand.

<mark>尽管这个新前沿令人振奋，但它带来了深刻的责任感，特别是从我作为全球金融机构首席信息官的角度来看。风险极其巨大。一个在创建"鸡肉三文鱼融合派"食谱时犯错误的智能体是一个有趣的轶事。一个在执行交易、管理风险或处理客户数据时犯错误的智能体是一个真正的问题。我读过免责声明和警示故事：网络自动化智能体在登录失败后，决定给议会成员发电子邮件抱怨登录墙。这是一个黑暗幽默的提醒，我们正在处理一种我们并不完全理解的技术。</mark>

This is where craft, culture, and a relentless focus on our principles become our essential guide. Our Engineering Tenets are not just words on a page; they are our compass. We must *Build with Purpose*, ensuring that every agent we design starts from a clear understanding of the client problem we are solving. We must *Look Around Corners*, anticipating failure modes and designing systems that are resilient by design. And above all, we must *Inspire Trust*, by being transparent about our methods and accountable for our outcomes.

<mark>这就是工艺、文化和对我们原则的不懈关注成为我们重要指南的地方。我们的工程原则不仅仅是纸上的文字；它们是我们的指南针。我们必须*有目的地构建*，确保我们设计的每个智能体都始于对我们要解决的客户问题的清晰理解。我们必须*未雨绸缪*，预期故障模式并设计本质上具有韧性的系统。最重要的是，我们必须*激发信任*，通过对我们的方法保持透明并对我们的结果承担责任。</mark>

In an agentic world, these tenets take on new urgency. The hard truth is that you cannot simply overlay these powerful new tools onto messy, inconsistent systems and expect good results. Messy systems plus agents are a recipe for disaster. An AI trained on "garbage" data doesn't just produce garbage-out; it produces plausible, confident garbage that can poison an entire process. Therefore, our first and most critical task is to prepare the ground. We must invest in clean data, consistent metadata, and well-defined APIs. We have to build the modern "interstate system" that allows these agents to operate safely and at high velocity. It is the hard,

<mark>在智能体的世界里，这些原则变得更加紧迫。严酷的事实是，你不能简单地将这些强大的新工具覆盖在混乱、不一致的系统上并期望获得良好的结果。混乱的系统加上智能体是灾难的配方。在"垃圾"数据上训练的 AI 不仅仅产生垃圾输出；它产生看似合理、自信的垃圾，可能毒害整个过程。因此，我们的首要和最关键任务是准备基础。我们必须投资于干净的数据、一致的元数据和定义良好的 API。我们必须构建现代化的"州际系统"，让这些智能体能够安全且高速运行。这是艰难的，</mark>

foundational work of building a programmable enterprise, an "enterprise as software," where our processes are as well-architected as our code.

<mark>构建可编程企业的基础性工作，一个"软件化的企业"，其中我们的流程像我们的代码一样架构良好。</mark>

Ultimately, this journey is not about replacing human ingenuity, but about augmenting it. It demands a new set of skills from all of us: the ability to explain a task with clarity, the wisdom to delegate, and the diligence to verify the quality of the output. It requires us to be humble, to acknowledge what we don't know, and to never stop learning. The pages that follow in this book offer a technical map for building these new frameworks. My hope is that you will use them not just to build what is possible, but to build what is right, what is robust, and what is responsible.

<mark>最终，这个旅程不是关于取代人类的创造力，而是关于增强它。它要求我们所有人掌握一套新的技能：清晰解释任务的能力、委派的智慧，以及验证输出质量的勤勉。它要求我们保持谦逊，承认我们不知道的事情，并且永远不要停止学习。本书接下来的页面为构建这些新框架提供了技术路线图。我希望你们不仅用它们来构建可能的东西，而且构建正确的、稳健的、负责任的东西。</mark>

The world is asking every engineer to step up. I am confident we are ready for the challenge.

<mark>世界要求每个工程师都要挺身而出。我相信我们已经准备好迎接挑战。</mark>

Enjoy the journey.

<mark>享受这个旅程。</mark>

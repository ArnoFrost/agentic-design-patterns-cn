# A Thought Leader's Perspective: Power and Responsibility | <mark>思想领袖的观点：权力与责任</mark>

Of all the technology cycles I've witnessed over the past four decades—from the birth of the personal computer and the web, to the revolutions in mobile and cloud—none has felt quite like this one. For years, the discourse around Artificial Intelligence was a familiar rhythm of hype and disillusionment, the so-called "AI summers" followed by long, cold winters. But this time, something is different. The conversation has palpably shifted. If the last eighteen months were about the engine -the breathtaking, almost vertical ascent of Large Language Models (LLMs)- the next era will be about the car we build around it. It will be about the frameworks that harness this raw power, transforming it from a generator of plausible text into a true agent of action.

<mark>在我过去四十年见证的所有技术周期中——从个人计算机与互联网的诞生，到移动与云计算的革命——没有一次像这次一样。多年来，围绕人工智能的讨论一直是熟悉的炒作与幻灭循环，所谓的「AI 之夏」过后总会迎来漫长寒冬。但这一次不同了。话题已经发生了明显转变。如果说过去十八个月聚焦于引擎，即大语言模型那令人叹为观止、几乎垂直攀升的能力，那么接下来真正重要的，将是我们如何围绕它构建生态：用哪些框架来驾驭这种强大而原始的能力，把它从一个能生成看似合理文本的工具，变成能够实际执行任务的智能代理。</mark>

I admit, I began as a skeptic. Plausibility, I've found, is often inversely proportional to one's own knowledge of a subject. Early models, for all their fluency, felt like they were operating with a kind of impostor syndrome, optimized for credibility over correctness. But then came the inflection point, a step-change brought about by a new class of "reasoning" models. Suddenly, we weren't just conversing with a statistical machine that predicted the next word in a sequence;

<mark>坦白说，我最初持怀疑态度。我发现，可信度往往与一个人对某一主题的了解程度成反比。早期模型虽然流畅，但似乎患有「冒名顶替综合征」，优化的是可信度而非正确性。但随后转折点来临——新一代「推理」模型带来了质的飞跃。突然间，我们不再只是与一台预测序列中下一个词的统计机器对话；</mark>

we were getting a peek into a nascent form of cognition.

<mark>我们正在窥见一种初露端倪的认知形态。</mark>

The first time I experimented with one of the new agentic coding tools, I felt that familiar spark of magic. I tasked it with a personal project I'd never found the time for: migrating a charity website from a simple web builder to a proper, modern CI/CD environment. For the next twenty minutes, it went to work, asking clarifying questions, requesting credentials, and providing status updates. It felt less like using a tool and more like collaborating with a junior developer. When it presented me with a fully deployable package, complete with impeccable documentation and unit tests, I was floored.

<mark>第一次试用这些新型智能体编程工具时，我感受到了那种熟悉的魔法般的惊喜。我交给它一个一直没时间做的个人项目：将一个慈善网站从简单的网站构建器迁移到现代规范的 CI/CD 环境。接下来的二十分钟里，它埋头工作，提出澄清问题、请求凭据，并不断反馈进展。这感觉更像是与一位初级开发者协作，而非使用工具。当它交付一个完整可部署的包，附带无可挑剔的文档和单元测试时，我惊呆了。</mark>

Of course, it wasn't perfect. It made mistakes. It got stuck. It required my supervision and, crucially, my judgment to steer it back on course. The experience drove home a lesson I've learned the hard way over a long career: you cannot afford to trust blindly. Yet, the process was fascinating. Peeking into its "chain of thought" was like watching a mind at work—messy, non-linear, full of starts, stops, and self-corrections, not unlike our own human reasoning. It wasn't a straight line; it was a random walk toward a solution. Here was the kernel of something new: not just an intelligence that could generate content, but one that could generate a *plan*.

<mark>当然，它并不完美。它会犯错，会卡壳。它需要我的监督，更关键的是需要我的判断来将它拉回正轨。这段经历再次印证了我在漫长职业生涯中艰难学到的教训：绝不能盲目信任。然而，整个过程极其迷人。窥视它的「思维链」就像观察一个大脑在运转——混乱、非线性、充满起步、停顿和自我纠正，与我们人类的推理过程如出一辙。这不是一条直线，而是通往解决方案的随机漫步。这里蕴含着某种新事物的本质：不仅是能生成内容的智能，更是能制定<em>计划</em>的智能。</mark>

This is the promise of agentic frameworks. It's the difference between a static subway map and a dynamic GPS that reroutes you in real-time. A classic rules-based automaton follows a fixed path; when it encounters an unexpected obstacle, it breaks. An AI agent, powered by a reasoning model, has the potential to observe, adapt, and find another way. It possesses a form of digital common sense that allows it to navigate the countless edge cases of reality. It represents a shift from simply telling a computer *what* to do, to explaining *why* we need something done and trusting it to figure out the *how*.

<mark>这就是智能体框架的价值所在。这如同静态地铁图与实时重新规划路线的动态 GPS 之间的差异。经典的基于规则的自动机遵循固定路径；一旦遇到意外障碍就会失效。而由推理模型驱动的 AI 智能体能够观察环境、灵活应对并寻找替代方案。它拥有某种数字化常识，能够应对现实中的无数边界情况。这标志着一种转变：从简单地告诉计算机<em>做什么</em>，到解释<em>为什么</em>需要完成某事，并信任它找出<em>如何做</em>。</mark>

As exhilarating as this new frontier is, it brings a profound sense of responsibility, particularly from my vantage point as the CIO of a global financial institution. The stakes are immeasurably high. An agent that makes a mistake while creating a recipe for a "Chicken Salmon Fusion Pie" is a fun anecdote. An agent that makes a mistake while executing a trade, managing risk, or handling client data is a real problem. I've read the disclaimers and the cautionary tales: the web automation agent that, after failing a login, decided to email a member of parliament to complain about login walls. It's a darkly humorous reminder that we are dealing with a technology we don't fully understand.

<mark>尽管这个新领域令人振奋，但它也带来了深重的责任感，尤其是从我作为全球金融机构 CIO 的视角来看。风险高得难以估量。智能体在创建「鸡肉三文鱼融合派」食谱时出错，只是个有趣的轶事；但若在执行交易、管理风险或处理客户数据时出错，那就是真正的问题了。我读过各种免责声明和警示故事：有个网络自动化智能体在登录失败后，竟决定给议会议员发邮件抱怨登录门槛。这个充满黑色幽默的案例提醒我们：我们正在使用一种尚未完全理解的技术。</mark>

This is where craft, culture, and a relentless focus on our principles become our essential guide. Our Engineering Tenets are not just words on a page; they are our compass. We must *Build with Purpose*, ensuring that every agent we design starts from a clear understanding of the client problem we are solving. We must *Look Around Corners*, anticipating failure modes and designing systems that are resilient by design. And above all, we must *Inspire Trust*, by being transparent about our methods and accountable for our outcomes.

<mark>这就是工艺精神、企业文化和对核心原则的不懈坚守成为我们重要指南的原因。我们的工程原则不只是纸面文字，它们是我们的指南针。我们必须<em>有目的地构建</em>，确保设计的每个智能体都始于对客户问题的清晰理解。我们必须<em>未雨绸缪</em>，预判故障模式并设计本质上具有韧性的系统。最重要的是，我们必须<em>赢得信任</em>，通过保持方法的透明性并对结果负责。</mark>

In an agentic world, these tenets take on new urgency. The hard truth is that you cannot simply overlay these powerful new tools onto messy, inconsistent systems and expect good results. Messy systems plus agents are a recipe for disaster. An AI trained on "garbage" data doesn't just produce garbage-out; it produces plausible, confident garbage that can poison an entire process. Therefore, our first and most critical task is to prepare the ground. We must invest in clean data, consistent metadata, and well-defined APIs. We have to build the modern "interstate system" that allows these agents to operate safely and at high velocity. It is the hard, foundational work of building a programmable enterprise, an "enterprise as software," where our processes are as well-architected as our code.

<mark>在智能体的世界里，这些原则变得更加紧迫。残酷的现实是：你不能简单地把这些强大的新工具叠加到混乱、不一致的系统上，还指望得到好结果。混乱的系统加上智能体，无异于一场灾难。在「垃圾」数据上训练的 AI 不只是产出垃圾；它会产出看似可信且信心十足的垃圾，足以毒害整个流程。因此，我们的首要任务是打好基础。我们必须投资于干净的数据、一致的元数据和定义良好的 API。我们必须构建现代化的「州际公路系统」，让这些智能体能够安全高速地运行。这是艰苦的却是构建可编程企业的基础性工作——一个「软件即企业」的愿景，让我们的流程像代码一样被精心设计和架构化。</mark>

Ultimately, this journey is not about replacing human ingenuity, but about augmenting it. It demands a new set of skills from all of us: the ability to explain a task with clarity, the wisdom to delegate, and the diligence to verify the quality of the output. It requires us to be humble, to acknowledge what we don't know, and to never stop learning. The pages that follow in this book offer a technical map for building these new frameworks. My hope is that you will use them not just to build what is possible, but to build what is right, what is robust, and what is responsible.

<mark>归根结底，这段旅程不是为了取代人类的创造力，而是为了增强它。它要求我们掌握一套新技能：清晰阐述任务的能力、明智委派的智慧，以及严格验证输出质量的勤勉。它也要求我们保持谦逊，承认自己的无知，永不停止学习。本书接下来的内容提供了构建这些新型框架的技术路线图。我的期望是，你们不仅用这些方法去实现可能的事情，更要去构建正确的、可靠的、负责任的成果。</mark>

The world is asking every engineer to step up. I am confident we are ready for the challenge.

<mark>这个世界需要每一位工程师挺身而出。我相信我们已经准备好迎接这一挑战。</mark>

Enjoy the journey.

<mark>愿你享受这段旅程。</mark>

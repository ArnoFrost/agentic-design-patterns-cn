# A Thought Leader's Perspective: Power and Responsibility | <mark>思想领袖的观点：权力与责任</mark>

Of all the technology cycles I've witnessed over the past four decades—from the birth of the personal computer and the web, to the revolutions in mobile and cloud—none has felt quite like this one. For years, the discourse around Artificial Intelligence was a familiar rhythm of hype and disillusionment, the so-called "AI summers" followed by long, cold winters. But this time, something is different. The conversation has palpably shifted. If the last eighteen months were about the engine -the breathtaking, almost vertical ascent of Large Language Models (LLMs)- the next era will be about the car we build around it. It will be about the frameworks that harness this raw power, transforming it from a generator of plausible text into a true agent of action.

<mark>在我过去四十年所经历的技术周期中——从个人计算机与互联网的诞生，到移动与云计算的革命——从未有一次如当下这般不同。多年来，围绕人工智能的讨论总在炒作与幻灭的节奏中起伏，所谓「AI 之夏」之后往往紧随漫长寒冬。可这一次确实变了——话题的重心明显转移。如果说过去十八个月关注的是「引擎」，即大语言模型那几乎垂直攀升的惊人能力，那么接下来真正重要的，是我们如何围绕它「造车」：用怎样的框架驯服这股原始而强大的力量，把它从能生成看似合理文本的器具，打造成真正能付诸行动的智能体。</mark>

I admit, I began as a skeptic. Plausibility, I've found, is often inversely proportional to one's own knowledge of a subject. Early models, for all their fluency, felt like they were operating with a kind of impostor syndrome, optimized for credibility over correctness. But then came the inflection point, a step-change brought about by a new class of "reasoning" models. Suddenly, we weren't just conversing with a statistical machine that predicted the next word in a sequence;

<mark>坦白说，我起初是怀疑的。我发现，「看起来可信」往往与一个人对主题的了解程度成反比。早期模型虽流畅，却仿佛患上了「冒名顶替综合征」，将「显得可靠」置于「确保正确」之上。直到拐点到来——新一代「推理」模型带来质变。突然间，我们不再只是对着一台预测下一个词的统计机器说话；</mark>

we were getting a peek into a nascent form of cognition.

<mark>我们得以窥见一种初生的「认知」。</mark>

The first time I experimented with one of the new agentic coding tools, I felt that familiar spark of magic. I tasked it with a personal project I'd never found the time for: migrating a charity website from a simple web builder to a proper, modern CI/CD environment. For the next twenty minutes, it went to work, asking clarifying questions, requesting credentials, and providing status updates. It felt less like using a tool and more like collaborating with a junior developer. When it presented me with a fully deployable package, complete with impeccable documentation and unit tests, I was floored.

<mark>第一次试用这些新型智能体编程工具时，那种熟悉的「魔法」火花再次跳动。我让它去做一个一直无暇推进的私事：把一个慈善网站从简易的站点构建器，迁移到符合现代规范的 CI/CD 环境。接下来的二十分钟里，它埋头推进，提出澄清问题、请求凭据、不断同步进度。那感觉更像与一位初级开发者协作，而非仅仅使用一件工具。当它呈上一份完整可部署的包，配以无可挑剔的文档与单元测试时，我由衷震撼。</mark>

Of course, it wasn't perfect. It made mistakes. It got stuck. It required my supervision and, crucially, my judgment to steer it back on course. The experience drove home a lesson I've learned the hard way over a long career: you cannot afford to trust blindly. Yet, the process was fascinating. Peeking into its "chain of thought" was like watching a mind at work—messy, non-linear, full of starts, stops, and self-corrections, not unlike our own human reasoning. It wasn't a straight line; it was a random walk toward a solution. Here was the kernel of something new: not just an intelligence that could generate content, but one that could generate a *plan*.

<mark>当然，它并不完美：会犯错，也会卡壳。它需要我的监督，更需要我在关键时刻以判断力把它拉回正轨。这段经历再次印证我在漫长职业生涯中学到的教训：切不可盲目信任。尽管如此，过程本身极具魅力。窥视它的「思维链」，宛若观看一颗大脑的运作——杂乱、非线性，充满起步、停顿与自我修正，与我们人类的推理别无二致。那不是一条直线，而是一场通往解的随机漫步。这里孕育着全新的内核：不仅能生成内容的智能，更是能生成<em>计划</em>的智能。</mark>

This is the promise of agentic frameworks. It's the difference between a static subway map and a dynamic GPS that reroutes you in real-time. A classic rules-based automaton follows a fixed path; when it encounters an unexpected obstacle, it breaks. An AI agent, powered by a reasoning model, has the potential to observe, adapt, and find another way. It possesses a form of digital common sense that allows it to navigate the countless edge cases of reality. It represents a shift from simply telling a computer *what* to do, to explaining *why* we need something done and trusting it to figure out the *how*.

<mark>这正是智能体框架的承诺所在。它就像静态地铁图与能实时改道的动态 GPS 之间的差别。传统的基于规则的自动机按既定路径前行，遇到意外障碍便告失灵；而由推理模型驱动的 AI 智能体，具备观察、适应与另辟蹊径的潜能。它拥有某种数字常识，得以游刃有余地穿越现实中的无数边界情形。这意味着一种转变：不再只是告诉计算机<em>做什么</em>，而是解释<em>为何而做</em>，并信任它找出<em>如何去做</em>。</mark>

As exhilarating as this new frontier is, it brings a profound sense of responsibility, particularly from my vantage point as the CIO of a global financial institution. The stakes are immeasurably high. An agent that makes a mistake while creating a recipe for a "Chicken Salmon Fusion Pie" is a fun anecdote. An agent that makes a mistake while executing a trade, managing risk, or handling client data is a real problem. I've read the disclaimers and the cautionary tales: the web automation agent that, after failing a login, decided to email a member of parliament to complain about login walls. It's a darkly humorous reminder that we are dealing with a technology we don't fully understand.

<mark>然而，这片前沿也意味着沉甸甸的责任，尤其站在一家全球性金融机构 CIO 的位置上。风险高到难以估量：智能体在编「鸡肉三文鱼融合派」食谱时出错，或许只是笑谈；可若在执行交易、管理风险、处理客户数据时犯错，便关乎真切的后果。我读过诸多免责声明与警示故事：有个网络自动化智能体在登录失败后，竟给议会议员发邮件抱怨登录「墙」。这则黑色幽默提醒我们——我们在使用一种尚未被彻底理解的技术。</mark>

This is where craft, culture, and a relentless focus on our principles become our essential guide. Our Engineering Tenets are not just words on a page; they are our compass. We must *Build with Purpose*, ensuring that every agent we design starts from a clear understanding of the client problem we are solving. We must *Look Around Corners*, anticipating failure modes and designing systems that are resilient by design. And above all, we must *Inspire Trust*, by being transparent about our methods and accountable for our outcomes.

<mark>这正是工艺、文化与对原则的执着成为指路明灯的原因。我们的工程信条不是纸上的口号，而是我们的指南针。我们必须<em>有目的地构建</em>：让每个智能体的设计，始于对客户问题的清晰理解。我们必须<em>未雨绸缪</em>：预判故障模式，打造“以韧性为先”的系统。最重要的是，我们必须<em>赢得信任</em>：保持方法透明，并对结果负责。</mark>

In an agentic world, these tenets take on new urgency. The hard truth is that you cannot simply overlay these powerful new tools onto messy, inconsistent systems and expect good results. Messy systems plus agents are a recipe for disaster. An AI trained on "garbage" data doesn't just produce garbage-out; it produces plausible, confident garbage that can poison an entire process. Therefore, our first and most critical task is to prepare the ground. We must invest in clean data, consistent metadata, and well-defined APIs. We have to build the modern "interstate system" that allows these agents to operate safely and at high velocity. It is the hard, foundational work of building a programmable enterprise, an "enterprise as software," where our processes are as well-architected as our code.

<mark>在智能体的世界里，这些原则更显紧迫。冷酷事实是：不能把强大的新工具随意叠加在混乱、前后不一的系统之上，还妄图收获好结果。混乱系统叠上智能体，注定是灾难。在“垃圾”数据上训练出来的 AI，不止产出垃圾；更会生成看似可信、信心十足的垃圾，足以“毒害”整个流程。因此，首务是“夯实地基”。我们必须投入干净的数据、统一的元数据与定义清晰的 API；必须修建现代化的“州际高速公路系统”，让智能体得以安全且高速地运行。这些艰苦却基础的工程，旨在打造“可编程企业”——让我们的流程像代码一般被精心架构。</mark>

Ultimately, this journey is not about replacing human ingenuity, but about augmenting it. It demands a new set of skills from all of us: the ability to explain a task with clarity, the wisdom to delegate, and the diligence to verify the quality of the output. It requires us to be humble, to acknowledge what we don't know, and to never stop learning. The pages that follow in this book offer a technical map for building these new frameworks. My hope is that you will use them not just to build what is possible, but to build what is right, what is robust, and what is responsible.

<mark>归根到底，这场旅程并非为了替代人类的创造力，而是为了增强它。这要求我们掌握一组新的能力：把任务说清的表达力、懂得授权的判断力，以及验证输出质量的勤勉。它也要求我们保持谦逊，承认未知，并永不停学。本书接下来的篇章给出搭建这些新框架的技术地图。愿各位不止于“把可能之事做成”，更能“把正确、可靠且负责任的事做好”。</mark>

The world is asking every engineer to step up. I am confident we are ready for the challenge.

<mark>这个世界正在召唤每一位工程师挺身而出。我相信，我们已经准备好迎接挑战。</mark>

Enjoy the journey.

<mark>愿你享受这段旅程。</mark>

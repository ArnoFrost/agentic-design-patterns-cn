# A Thought Leader's Perspective: Power and Responsibility | <mark>思想领袖的观点：权力与责任</mark>

Of all the technology cycles I've witnessed over the past four decades—from the birth of the personal computer and the web, to the revolutions in mobile and cloud—none has felt quite like this one. For years, the discourse around Artificial Intelligence was a familiar rhythm of hype and disillusionment, the so-called "AI summers" followed by long, cold winters. But this time, something is different. The conversation has palpably shifted. If the last eighteen months were

<mark>在我过去四十年见证的所有技术周期中——从个人计算机与互联网的诞生，到移动与云计算的革命——没有一次像这次这样让人印象深刻。多年来，围绕人工智能的讨论是一种熟悉的炒作与失望的循环，所谓的「AI 夏天」之后总伴随漫长而寒冷的冬天。但这一次，情况有所不同。对话已经明显转向。如果说过去十八个月是</mark>

about the engine—the breathtaking, almost vertical ascent of Large Language Models (LLMs)—the next era will be about the car we build around it. It will be about the frameworks that harness this raw power, transforming it from a generator of plausible text into a true agent of action.

<mark>关于引擎——大语言模型（LLM）令人叹为观止、几近垂直的跃升——那么下一个时代将聚焦于我们围绕它构建的「汽车」。它将关乎能够驾驭这种原始力量的框架，将其从看似合理的文本生成器，转变为真正的行动智能体。</mark>

I admit, I began as a skeptic. Plausibility, I've found, is often inversely proportional to one's own knowledge of a subject. Early models, for all their fluency, felt like they were operating with a kind of impostor syndrome, optimized for credibility over correctness. But then came the inflection point, a step-change brought about by a new class of "reasoning" models. Suddenly, we weren't just conversing with a statistical machine that predicted the next word in a sequence;

<mark>我承认，我最初是一个怀疑论者。我发现，所谓「看起来可信」往往与一个人对某一主题的了解成反比。早期模型尽管流畅，但仿佛患有冒名顶替综合征，更偏向可信度而非正确性。直到转折点到来——由新一代「推理」模型带来的阶跃变化。突然间，我们不再只是与一个预测序列下一个词的统计机器对话；</mark>

we were getting a peek into a nascent form of cognition.

<mark>我们正在窥探一种新生的认知形式。</mark>

The first time I experimented with one of the new agentic coding tools, I felt that familiar spark of magic. I tasked it with a personal project I'd never found the time for: migrating a charity website from a simple web builder to a proper, modern CI/CD environment. For the next twenty minutes, it went to work, asking clarifying questions, requesting credentials, and providing status updates. It felt less like using a tool and more like collaborating with a junior developer. When it presented me with a fully deployable package, complete with impeccable documentation and unit tests, I was floored.

<mark>当我第一次尝试这些新的智能体编程工具之一时，感受到了那种熟悉的魔法火花。我给它安排了一个我一直没有时间做的个人项目：将一个慈善网站从简单的网站构建器迁移到现代而规范的 CI/CD 环境。在接下来的二十分钟里，它开始工作，提出澄清性问题、请求凭据，并提供状态更新。那一刻更像是与一位初级开发者协作，而非使用一件工具。当它呈现出一个可完整部署的包，并配以无可挑剔的文档与单元测试时，我为之震撼。</mark>

Of course, it wasn't perfect. It made mistakes. It got stuck. It required my supervision and, crucially, my judgment to steer it back on course. The experience drove home a lesson I've learned the hard way over a long career: you cannot afford to trust blindly. Yet, the process was fascinating. Peeking into its "chain of thought" was like watching a mind at work—messy, non-linear, full of starts, stops, and self-corrections, not unlike our own human reasoning. It wasn't a straight line; it was a random walk toward a solution. Here was the kernel of something new: not just an intelligence that could generate content, but one that could generate a *plan*.

<mark>当然，它并不完美。它会犯错，也会卡住。它需要我的监督，更需要我的判断力把它拉回正轨。这段经历让我再一次领悟到一个职场中反复验证的教训：不能盲目信任。然而，这个过程极其迷人。窥视其「思维链」如同观察一个头脑在运作——杂乱、非线性、充满开始与停止、并伴随自我纠正，与我们的人类推理并无二致。这不是一条直线，而是朝向解法的随机游走。这里蕴含着某种新事物的内核：不只是能生成内容的智能，更是能生成「计划」的智能。</mark>

This is the promise of agentic frameworks. It's the difference between a static subway map and a dynamic GPS that reroutes you in real-time. A classic rules-based automaton follows a fixed path; when it encounters an unexpected obstacle, it breaks. An AI agent, powered by a reasoning model, has the potential to observe, adapt, and find another way. It possesses a form of digital common sense that allows it to navigate the countless edge cases of reality. It represents a shift from simply telling a computer *what* to do, to explaining *why* we need something done and trusting it to figure out the *how*.

<mark>这就是智能体框架的承诺。这就像静态地铁图与可实时重路由的动态 GPS 之间的差异。经典的基于规则的自动机遵循固定路径；一旦遇到意外障碍便会失效。由推理模型驱动的 AI 智能体具备观察、适应并另辟蹊径的潜力。它拥有某种数字化常识，得以应对现实中无数边界情形。它标志着一种转变：从仅仅告诉计算机「做什么」，到解释「为什么」需要完成某事，并信任它找出「如何去做」。</mark>

As exhilarating as this new frontier is, it brings a profound sense of responsibility, particularly from my vantage point as the CIO of a global financial institution. The stakes are immeasurably high. An agent that makes a mistake while creating a recipe for a "Chicken Salmon Fusion Pie" is a fun anecdote. An agent that makes a mistake while executing a trade, managing risk, or handling client data is a real problem. I've read the disclaimers and the cautionary tales: the web automation agent that, after failing a login, decided to email a member of parliament to complain about login walls. It's a darkly humorous reminder that we are dealing with a technology we don't fully understand.

<mark>尽管这个新前沿令人振奋，但也伴随着沉甸甸的责任，特别是站在全球金融机构 CIO 的视角。风险之高，不容低估。一个在创建「鸡肉三文鱼融合派」食谱时出错的智能体，充其量只是个趣闻；但若在执行交易、管理风险或处理客户数据时犯错，那就成了严肃问题。我也读过种种免责声明与警示故事：有个网络自动化智能体在登录失败后，竟决定给议会议员发邮件抱怨登录墙。这种黑色幽默提醒我们：我们正在使用一种尚未被完全理解的技术。</mark>

This is where craft, culture, and a relentless focus on our principles become our essential guide. Our Engineering Tenets are not just words on a page; they are our compass. We must *Build with Purpose*, ensuring that every agent we design starts from a clear understanding of the client problem we are solving. We must *Look Around Corners*, anticipating failure modes and designing systems that are resilient by design. And above all, we must *Inspire Trust*, by being transparent about our methods and accountable for our outcomes.

<mark>这就是工艺、文化和对我们原则的不懈关注成为我们重要指南的地方。我们的工程原则不仅仅是纸上的文字；它们是我们的指南针。我们必须*有目的地构建*，确保我们设计的每个智能体都始于对我们要解决的客户问题的清晰理解。我们必须*未雨绸缪*，预期故障模式并设计本质上具有韧性的系统。最重要的是，我们必须*激发信任*，通过对我们的方法保持透明并对我们的结果承担责任。</mark>

In an agentic world, these tenets take on new urgency. The hard truth is that you cannot simply overlay these powerful new tools onto messy, inconsistent systems and expect good results. Messy systems plus agents are a recipe for disaster. An AI trained on "garbage" data doesn't just produce garbage-out; it produces plausible, confident garbage that can poison an entire process. Therefore, our first and most critical task is to prepare the ground. We must invest in clean data, consistent metadata, and well-defined APIs. We have to build the modern "interstate system" that allows these agents to operate safely and at high velocity. It is the hard,

<mark>在智能体的世界里，这些原则更显紧迫。冷酷的现实是：你不能把这些强大的新工具直接覆盖到混乱、不一致的系统上，还指望获得好结果。混乱系统加上智能体，几乎等于灾难。在「垃圾」数据上训练出来的 AI，不只是垃圾输出；它还会生成看似可信且底气十足的垃圾，足以污染整个流程。因此，我们的第一要务是夯实地基。我们必须投入于干净的数据、一致的元数据，以及定义良好的 API。我们还要建设现代化的「州际高速公路系统」，让这些智能体能够安全且高速地运行。这虽然艰难，</mark>

foundational work of building a programmable enterprise, an "enterprise as software," where our processes are as well-architected as our code.

<mark>却是构建可编程企业的基础工程——一个「软件化的企业」，其中我们的流程如同代码般架构良好。</mark>

Ultimately, this journey is not about replacing human ingenuity, but about augmenting it. It demands a new set of skills from all of us: the ability to explain a task with clarity, the wisdom to delegate, and the diligence to verify the quality of the output. It requires us to be humble, to acknowledge what we don't know, and to never stop learning. The pages that follow in this book offer a technical map for building these new frameworks. My hope is that you will use them not just to build what is possible, but to build what is right, what is robust, and what is responsible.

<mark>最终，这段旅程不是为了取代人类创造力，而是为了增强它。它要求我们掌握一套新技能：清晰阐述任务的能力、明智的委派，以及对输出质量的严格核验。它也要求我们保持谦逊，承认自身未知，并永不停歇地学习。本书接下来的内容提供了构建这些新型框架的技术路线图。我希望你们不仅用它们去构建可能之物，更要构建正确、稳健且负责任之物。</mark>

The world is asking every engineer to step up. I am confident we are ready for the challenge.

<mark>当下的世界，需要每一位工程师挺身而出。我相信我们已做好迎接挑战的准备。</mark>

Enjoy the journey.

<mark>请享受这段旅程。</mark>
